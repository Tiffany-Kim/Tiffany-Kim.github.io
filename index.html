						<h2>Devotion (2022): My Honest Review</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Despite the minimal attention Top Gun: Maverick received at The 2023 Oscars, no one can tell me it wasn’t the most memorable film of 2022. As we near the 1-year anniversary of the release of Top Gun: Maverick, I recently found myself rewatching clips and looking to relive the action-packed experience. While doing so, I was reminded of a similar film called “Devotion”, which premiered not long after the Top Gun sequel and also starred Glen Powell, the same actor who played “Hangman” in Top Gun: Maverick. 

Devotion portrays the story of Ensign Jesse L. Brown, the first African-American aviator for the US Navy, and his Navy Fighter Squadron as they fight in the Korean War. I recalled my friend saying it was “basically another version of Top Gun”, also that “it was really, really sad”. I decided I’d give it a shot! 

My one sentence review of Devotion: “It had so much potential.” Ultimately, it was a disappointing film.

For me, the biggest difference between a good film and a bad film is the amount of thinking it induces. And not in the way you would think. When I’m watching a good movie, I’m rarely thinking. Instead, I am deeply immersed in the story. The dialogue, and the characters transport me into their world and away from mine. On the other hand, when I’m watching a bad movie, a constant train of thoughts is running through my mind, usually a mix of confusion or irritation. Why did they have to cut the scene like that? Why is the dialogue so flat? What is the point of this character even? These are some of the many questions I asked myself as two hours passed by. 

I don’t want to compare this movie to Top Gun: Maverick because it’s not worthy of being compared, but the story depicted in Devotion is probably closer to reality. The truth is, not everyone in war dies in a dramatic way. People just die. From wounds, from infection, from starvation, and so on. And sadly, there is no hero that shows up just in time to save you. Maybe because Devotion didn’t have these elements, it was a less exciting cinematic experience. However, no one can deny how sad or realistic of a wartime portrayal it was. If this was the director’s aim, I think he did a satisfactory job. 

But the scene where Mohring crashes the Corsair into the ocean and dies? No one’s even going to try to save him? Everyone just stood at the edge of the carrier and stared at the water, as if they dropped something and were waiting for it to emerge to the surface. </p>

						<h2>I am more than just four letters</h2>
					</header>
					<p>As a Korean person who tends to gravitate towards more Korean communities and social situations, one of the questions I get asked most is “What is your MBTI?” Asking one’s MBTI has become the social norm, joining the growing list of things Korea is renowned for globally, standing alongside K-pop and skincare. 

There are a total of 16 MBTI personality types, which is determined by a 30+ question quiz that you take about yourself. The key is to not mull over the answers excessively. You just have to go with your gut! The first letter will either be an E or I, depending on whether you are more extroverted or introverted. Next is a N or S, the former being a representation of individuals who tend to be more imaginative, and the latter pertaining to personality types that like to look at the facts. The third letter slot describes how individuals make decisions and judgements - a T usually means that you prioritize logic and rationality, whereas a F describes those who prioritize harmony and compassion. In other words, F = emotional (that’s me!). And finally, the final letter will either be a J or P depending on whether you prefer to stick to a structured and organized lifestyle, or if you thrive on spontaneity, respectively. 

The first time I took the Myers-Briggs personality test was in middle school as part of a mandatory classroom exercise. Never would I have imagined that we’d still be talking about it in 2023, especially not at the depth it is discussed today. One thing I can say for sure is that my personality type has changed immensely since my teenage years — what a relief. My younger self highly preferred spending time alone, usually at home or in the nearest Indigo. Over the years, I’ve grown to love meeting new people, and exploring the weirdest and most mysterious corners of flashing, metropolitan cities. 

Regardless of where one comes from, I think we all take pride in how well we know the people in our lives. If not, there is at least an expectation from our friends and family that we should be capable of effortlessly recalling their favourite foods, musical artists, and pet peeves. An unfortunate consequence of this syndrome is that people often prematurely make assumptions about someone’s personality based on their MBTI type, before taking the time to genuinely get to know the individual. While I certainly believe that MBTI can be a great conversation starter, especially in awfully awkward situations, I think it’s important to remember that human beings are incredibly complex, weird, and particular. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my 2n years of life, it’s that this world likes to categorize people. Smart, dumb. Pretty, ugly. Kind, mean. Funny, boring. However, people aren’t the same as symptoms that can be checked off as a simple Yes or No. I am not the same. I am more than just four letters.
